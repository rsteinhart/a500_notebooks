# Project list for A500

* Andrew -- convective circulation in a valley complex train
  - dales run with sloping boundaries --- Phil, will get a prototype run
  
* Chris -- wrf fire, boundary layer question: how good in the model at capturing realisitc
         (Steve Krueger, Mary Ann Jenkins, ground truth)  Step: power spectra.
         
         or radix layer -- bao tower, sonds intercomparison
         
* Eve --- understand forecast model boundary layer parameterization and compare with tower or sonde data

* Chitra -- footprints, dales passive decaying -- small z0

* rivka -- heat flux, mo, bl height, deltT vs. concentrations pm 2.5 at NAPSS

* rachel -- rico run with dales, compare bahamas cases for RICO intercomparison paper
